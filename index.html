  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <br>
  <img class="profile-pic" src="./assets/images/profile.jpg" alt="Profile Picture" style="width:200px" class="responsive">


  <p>I am a recently certified Full-Stack Web Developer seeking to utilize my strong problem solving and leadership skills
    to help individuals, companies and clients optimize their web applications and data processes.</p>
    <p>After graduating from the University of Austin in 2006 with a bachelor’s in Biology, I had the opportunity to utilize
      my natural, quick learning ability and strong leadership skills in the oil and gas service industry. In the last twelve
      years I have held positions as a laboratory technician, project manager, field specialist, laboratory supervisor and
      technical advisor. I have also helped develop training course and enjoyed being a mentor and teacher to new employees.
      As a supervisor, I’ve had the opportunity to work with a great team and together we maximized project efficiency and
      maintained great client communication. This effort in turn led to exceeding our revenue goals, retaining customers
      and presenting our lab as a reputable fluid analysis provider.</p>
      <p>I have a strong desire to be challenged daily and in helping others in my professional career. With my broad professional
        experience, strong drive and work ethic, and love for web development, I have no doubt of being an immediate asset
        for an employer willing to provide the opportunity to showcase my skills.</p>
