        <p id="paragraph-one">I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 2006.  I have been in the Oil and Gas Service Industry for the last
            twelve years. It has been very rewarding, as it has allowed me to collaborate and befriend others, travel the world and provide for my family.
            I am excited to undertake the challenge of becoming a Full Stack Web Developer and broaden my skill set so that new opportunities are available.  
            I am excited to be a part of this program and look forward to all the changes I will make to my porfolio in the months to come.
